# Database Update Summary

## Changes Applied

1. **Fixed Cascade Path Issues**:
   - Modified the foreign key constraints in the `Messages` table to use `NO_ACTION` instead of `CASCADE` for both `SenderId` and `ReceiverId` to prevent multiple cascade paths.
   - Verified the foreign key constraints were correctly applied.

2. **Added Missing Tables**:
   - `UserDocuments` - For storing user document files and their metadata
   - `AppointmentAttachments` - For storing attachments related to appointments
   - `AppointmentFiles` - For storing files related to appointments
   - `Users` - Additional user management table

3. **Added Missing Columns in AspNetUsers Table**:
   - `MiddleName` - Added to store middle name
   - `Suffix` - Added to store name suffix 
   - `Status` - Added to store user status
   - `HasAgreedToTerms` - Added to track user agreement to terms
   - `AgreedAt` - Added to track when user agreed to terms

4. **Added Other New Columns**:
   - Added `MedicationId` to `PrescriptionMedications` table
   - Added `Medications` to `MedicalRecords` table
   - Added `RecordDate` to `MedicalRecords` table

5. **Modified Data Types**:
   - Updated various column data types to ensure consistency
   - Made appropriate NULL/NOT NULL adjustments

6. **Added Indexes**:
   - Created indexes for various foreign keys to improve query performance

## Migration Scripts Created

1. `fix-cascade-paths.sql` - Fixes the cascade path issues in the Messages table
2. `create-user-documents-table.sql` - Creates the UserDocuments table
3. `add-missing-user-columns.sql` - Adds missing columns to AspNetUsers table
4. `update-database-safely.bat` - Batch file for safely updating the database in the future

## Future Recommendations

1. **Always Create Migrations** - Use Entity Framework migrations to keep database schema in sync with model changes:
   ```
   dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Backup Before Updates** - Always create a database backup before applying migrations
3. **Test in Development** - Apply migrations to development environment first before production
4. **Monitor for Missing Tables/Columns** - Regularly check that all entities in your DbContext have corresponding tables/columns in the database

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Columns in AspNetUsers Table** - Application was trying to access columns that didn't exist in the database
2. **Missing UserDocuments Table** - Table was defined in DbContext but missing in database
3. **Cascade Path Issues** - Multiple cascade paths in Messages table were preventing proper updates

## Migration Files

The following migration files were applied:
- All previously pending migrations
- A custom migration `20250620000001_SetMessagesConstraintsToNoAction` to fix the cascade paths issue

## Verification

The foreign key constraints in the `Messages` table have been verified and are now set to use `NO_ACTION` for both `SenderId` and `ReceiverId` relationships, preventing issues with multiple cascade paths.

```sql
SELECT 
    fk.name AS 'Foreign Key', 
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) AS 'Table',
    COL_NAME(fkc.parent_object_id, fkc.parent_column_id) AS 'Column',
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) AS 'Referenced Table',
    fk.delete_referential_action_desc AS 'Delete Action'
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys fk
INNER JOIN 
    sys.foreign_key_columns fkc ON fk.object_id = fkc.constraint_object_id
WHERE 
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) = 'Messages'
ORDER BY 
    fk.name;
```

Results confirmed that the constraints are correctly set.

## Scripts Created

1. **add-missing-columns.sql**
   - Adds the missing columns to AspNetUsers table

2. **fix-cascade-paths.sql**
   - Fixes the cascade path issues in Messages table

3. **mark-migrations-as-applied.sql**
   - Marks all migrations as applied in the EF Core migrations history table

4. **update-database-schema.sql**
   - Updates the database schema with necessary changes

5. **complete-database-update.sql**
   - Comprehensive script that combines all the above fixes

6. **verify-database.sql**
   - Verifies that the database is properly updated and working

## How to Update the Database

For detailed instructions on how to update the database, please refer to the `database-update-instructions.md` file.

## Verification Results

The database verification script confirmed that:

1. AspNetUsers table has all required columns
2. Messages table foreign key constraints are properly set to NO ACTION
3. All required tables exist in the database
4. All migrations are properly applied
5. No tables are missing primary keys
6. No problematic CASCADE DELETE constraints exist

## Next Steps

1. Run the application to ensure it works properly
2. Monitor for any database-related errors
3. If needed, use the verification script to check the database status
4. For future updates, use the provided scripts and instructions
