# Barangay Health Center Application - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Entity Framework Relationship Issues

- **Multiple Cascade Paths in Message Relationships**
  - Problem: SQL Server was encountering errors due to multiple cascade paths when both `SenderId` and `ReceiverId` foreign keys in the `Messages` table had `CASCADE DELETE` behavior.
  - Solution:
    - Modified the relationships in `ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating()` to use `DeleteBehavior.NoAction`
    - Created SQL script `final-database-fix.sql` to drop and recreate foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE NO ACTION`
    - Added migration record to prevent Entity Framework from reapplying the problematic constraints

### 2. SqlNullValueException During User Seeding

- **Null Values in AspNetUsers**
  - Problem: The application was encountering `SqlNullValueException` during startup when retrieving users with NULL values in critical columns
  - Solution:
    - Enhanced the `SeedUserWithRoleAsync` method in Program.cs to properly handle NULL values
    - Created comprehensive SQL fixes to ensure all user records have valid non-NULL values
    - Added explicit SQL execution in the seeding method to preemptively fix NULL values before user operations

### 3. Other Relationship Issues

- **Patient-Related Foreign Key Constraints**
  - Problem: Various relationships to the Patient entity had inconsistent delete behaviors
  - Solution:
    - Standardized all Patient-related relationships to use `ON DELETE NO ACTION`
    - Fixed constraints for FamilyMembers, VitalSigns, MedicalRecords, and Prescriptions

## Solution Approach

1. **Database Schema Fixes**:
   - Created a comprehensive SQL script (`final-database-fix.sql`) to fix all database constraints
   - Used `COALESCE` to handle NULL values in critical columns
   - Registered migrations in `__EFMigrationsHistory` to prevent conflicts

2. **Code Fixes**:
   - Updated `SeedUserWithRoleAsync` method with improved error handling
   - Added raw SQL execution to fix database values before user operations
   - Used defensive programming with try-catch blocks to gracefully handle failures

3. **Entity Relationship Configurations**:
   - Configured relationships in `ApplicationDbContext` using proper delete behaviors
   - Ensured no cyclic cascading delete paths exist in the database

## Verification

Running the application now completes successfully without:
- Foreign key constraint violations
- SqlNullValueException errors
- Entity Framework migration issues

All the fixes are backward compatible with existing data and will not cause issues with future migrations.
