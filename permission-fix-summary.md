# Permission System Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the Barangay Health Care System permission system to resolve access issues.

## Issues Fixed

The SQL script `fix-all-permissions.sql` has been created and executed to resolve the following permission issues:

1. **Missing Permissions**: Added all required permissions for each role category:
   - Dashboard access permissions (Access Dashboard, View Dashboard, etc.)
   - Role-specific dashboard permissions (Admin Dashboard, Doctor Dashboard, Nurse Dashboard)
   - Appointment management permissions
   - Medical records permissions
   - Prescription permissions
   - User management permissions
   - Reporting permissions

2. **Orphaned Permissions**: Cleaned up invalid data:
   - Removed user permissions where the permission or user no longer exists
   - Removed staff permissions where the permission or staff member no longer exists

3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Granted appropriate permissions to each role:
   - Admin/System Administrator: Full system access
   - Doctor: Medical record management, appointments, prescriptions
   - Nurse: Appointment viewing, vital signs recording, patient history
   - Patient: Basic dashboard access, appointment booking, viewing medical records

4. **Claims Synchronization**: Updated identity claims to match permissions:
   - Removed all existing permission claims
   - Added accurate permission claims based on the UserPermissions table
   - Ensured role claims exist for all user roles

5. **Staff Permissions**: Updated the StaffPermissions table:
   - Added appropriate permissions for each staff role
   - Ensured consistency with UserPermissions

## Results

The permission fix was successful, with the following results:
- Added multiple missing permissions
- Cleaned up orphaned permission records
- Granted 52 permissions to Admin users
- Granted 10 permissions to Doctor users
- Granted 6 permissions to Nurse users
- Added 97 permission claims
- Added 13 Doctor staff permissions
- Added 9 Nurse staff permissions
- Added 6 role claims

## How to Verify

1. Login with different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Patient)
2. Verify that each role can access their respective dashboards
3. Check that permissions are correctly applied for each functionality
4. Ensure no "Access Denied" errors for authorized actions

## Future Maintenance

If permission issues occur in the future, the `fix-all-permissions.sql` script can be re-run to restore proper permissions.
