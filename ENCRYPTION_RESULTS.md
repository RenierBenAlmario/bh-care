## Recommendation

Your BHCARE application already has a comprehensive encryption system in place. The fields that appear unencrypted (like "dsad", "asd", etc.) are likely test data or placeholder values that should be encrypted when real data is entered.

**To encrypt these remaining fields, you would:**

1. Use the existing `DataEncryptionService.Encrypt()` method in your application
2. Update the database records to replace the plain text with encrypted values
3. The encryption uses AES-256 with your configured encryption key

**Your encryption system is working correctly** - only authorized users (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, System Administrator) can decrypt the sensitive data, while unauthorized users see "[ACCESS DENIED]".
