# Barangay Health Center Registration System Fix

This document provides instructions for fixing the registration and notification issues in the Barangay Health Center system.

## Problem Summary

The system has the following issues:
1. Users who register successfully are not being saved to the AspNetUsers table
2. Residency proof documents are not being saved to the UserDocuments table
3. The notification count shows pending users (e.g., "9") but no users are found in the database
4. The User Management page shows "No users found" under "Pending Approval"

## Solution Files

The following files have been created or modified to address these issues:

1. **Pages/Account/SignUp.cshtml.cs** - Fixed data persistence in the `ProcessRegistration` method
2. **Controllers/NotificationController.cs** - Added data validation and synchronization
3. **fix-notification-user-sync.sql** - SQL script to fix database inconsistencies
4. **run-database-fix.ps1** - PowerShell script to execute the SQL fix script
5. **verify-registration-fixes.ps1** - PowerShell script to test and verify the fixes

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement the fix:

### 1. Update the Code Files

   ```
3. Follow the prompts and review the results

### 3. Restart the Application

   - Start it again with:
     ```
     dotnet run
     ```

### 4. Verify the Fix

1. Open a PowerShell terminal in the project directory
2. Run the verification script:
   ```powershell
   .\verify-registration-fixes.ps1
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to test a new registration
4. Review the results to confirm the fix is working

## Technical Details of the Fix

### 1. Registration Process Improvements

The main issue was with the data persistence in the sign-up process. Key changes:

- Added proper error handling and sequential saving of related entities
- Ensured each save operation is completed before proceeding to the next one
- Added SaveChangesAsync calls at appropriate points for each entity
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the process

### 2. Data Synchronization

The notification system was showing inconsistent data. Key changes:

- Added synchronization between AspNetUsers and UserDocuments tables
- Fixed handling of orphaned notifications and documents
- Added validation to ensure counts are accurate
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. Database Cleanup

The SQL fix script performs the following:

- Marks orphaned notifications as read
- Fixes users with missing Status values
- Deletes orphaned documents
- Reconciles Status values between tables
- Fixes HasAgreedToTerms and AgreedAt values if needed

## Testing

After implementing the fix, test the following scenarios:

1. **New User Registration**
   - Register a new user with valid information and document
   - Verify the user appears in AspNetUsers with Status = 'Pending'
   - Verify the document appears in UserDocuments with Status = 'Pending'
   - Verify the notification count increases

2. **Admin User Management**
   - Log in as an admin
   - Check the User Management page
   - Verify pending users are displayed
   - Try approving a user and confirming the status changes

## Monitoring

To ensure the system continues to work correctly:

1. Monitor application logs for errors during registration
2. Periodically check for consistency between AspNetUsers and UserDocuments tables
3. If issues recur, run the database fix script and review the logs for new problems
