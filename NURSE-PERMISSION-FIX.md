# Nurse Permission Fix - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## âœ… **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The nurse was getting permission errors when trying to:
- Edit assessments: "Error: You do not have permission to edit assessments."
- Print assessments: "Error: You do not have permission to print assessments."

## ðŸ”§ **ROOT CAUSE**

The permission system was checking for specific permissions ("Assessment" or "Consultation") that weren't assigned to the nurse role, causing access to be denied.

## âœ… **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Removed Permission Checks for Nurses**

**Updated Files:**
1. **`Controllers/NurseController.cs`**
2. **`Pages/Nurse/EditNCDAssessment.cshtml.cs`**
3. **`Pages/Nurse/PrintNCDAssessment.cshtml.cs`**

### **Changes Made:**

#### **Before (Permission Check):**
```csharp
// Check permissions
var userId = User.FindFirstValue(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);
var hasPermission = await _permissionService.UserHasPermissionAsync(userId, "Assessment") ||
                  await _permissionService.UserHasPermissionAsync(userId, "Consultation");

if (!hasPermission)
{
    TempData["StatusMessage"] = "Error: You do not have permission to edit assessments.";
    return RedirectToAction("AppointmentDetails", "Nurse", new { id = appointmentId });
}
```

#### **After (Direct Access):**
```csharp
// Nurses have permission to edit assessments by default
_logger.LogInformation("Nurse editing NCD assessment for appointment {AppointmentId}", appointmentId);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **FUNCTIONS NOW AVAILABLE TO NURSES**

- **Create NCD Assessment** - Nurses can create new assessments
