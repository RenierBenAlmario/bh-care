# Address Field Fix - COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified
The address field was **NOT showing up** in the signup form because:
1. **Missing from HTML form** - The address field was not present in the `SignUp.cshtml` file
2. **Missing from model** - The `Address` property was not defined in the `InputModel` class

## Fix Applied

### 1. ✅ Added Address Property to Model (`Pages/Account/SignUp.cshtml.cs`)
```csharp
[Required(ErrorMessage = "Complete address is required")]
[Display(Name = "Complete Address")]
[StringLength(200, MinimumLength = 10, ErrorMessage = "Address must be between 10 and 200 characters.")]
public string Address { get; set; }
```

### 2. ✅ Added Address Field to HTML Form (`Pages/Account/SignUp.cshtml`)
```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="form-group">
            <label asp-for="Input.Address" class="form-label">Complete Address <span class="required">*</span></label>
            <div class="input-group">
                <span class="input-group-text">
                    <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>
                </span>
                <textarea asp-for="Input.Address" class="form-control" rows="2" placeholder="House No., Street, Barangay, City" required aria-label="Complete address input"></textarea>
            </div>
            <div class="invalid-feedback" id="addressError">Complete address is required</div>
            <small class="form-text text-muted">Please provide your complete address including house number, street, barangay, and city</small>
            <span asp-validation-for="Input.Address" class="text-danger"></span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. ✅ Updated User Creation Code
```csharp
Address = _encryptionService.Encrypt(Input.Address ?? "")
```

## Result
- ✅ **Address field now appears** in the signup form
- ✅ **Positioned correctly** between Contact Number and Birth Date
- ✅ **Proper validation** (required, 10-200 characters)
- ✅ **Data encryption** for security
- ✅ **Form binding works** correctly
- ✅ **Build successful** with no errors
