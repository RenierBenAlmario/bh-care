# Consultation Testing Enhancement - Show Tomorrow's Appointments

## ‚úÖ **ENHANCEMENT IMPLEMENTED**

Modified the Doctor's Consultation page to show **both today's and tomorrow's appointments** for testing purposes.

## üîß **Changes Made:**

### **1. Updated Consultation Logic (`Pages/Doctor/Consultation.cshtml.cs`)**
```csharp
// Enhanced query with better logging - Include tomorrow for testing
var today = DateTime.Now.Date;
var tomorrow = today.AddDays(1);

// Show all appointments for today AND tomorrow (for testing purposes)
ConsultationQueue = await _context.Appointments
    .Include(a => a.Patient)
        .ThenInclude(p => p.User)
    .Where(a => (a.AppointmentDate.Date == today || a.AppointmentDate.Date == tomorrow) && 
              validStatuses.Contains(a.Status))
    .OrderBy(a => a.AppointmentDate)
    .ThenBy(a => a.AppointmentTime)
    .ToListAsync();
```

### **2. Updated UI Messages (`Pages/Doctor/Consultation.cshtml`)**
- **Header**: Changed from "Consultation Queue" to "Consultation Queue (Today & Tomorrow)"
- **Empty State**: Updated message to "Today's and tomorrow's scheduled appointments will appear here."

### **3. Enhanced Logging**
- Added logging for both today and tomorrow's appointment counts
- Updated error messages to reflect the new search criteria

## üß™ **Testing Benefits:**

### **Before Enhancement:**
- ‚ùå Only showed today's appointments
- ‚ùå No appointments = empty queue
- ‚ùå Couldn't test consultation functionality

### **After Enhancement:**
- ‚úÖ Shows both today's and tomorrow's appointments
- ‚úÖ More appointments available for testing
- ‚úÖ Can test consultation with Tom or other patients
- ‚úÖ Can verify decryption is working properly

## üìã **How to Test:**

1. **Navigate to Consultation Page**
   - Go to `https://localhost:5003/Doctor/Consultation`
   - Login as `doctor@example.com`

2. **Look for Appointments**
   - Should now see appointments for both today and tomorrow
   - Look for "Tom" or any other patient

3. **Test Consultation**
   - Click on any appointment to start consultation
   - Verify patient data shows readable format (not encrypted strings)

4. **Verify Decryption**
   - Patient name should be readable (e.g., "Tom Smith")
   - Contact number should be readable (e.g., "123-456-7890")
   - Email should be readable (e.g., "tom@example.com")

## üéØ **Expected Results:**

- **Consultation Queue**: Shows appointments for today and tomorrow
- **Patient Data**: All sensitive information displays in readable format
- **Testing**: Can now test consultation functionality with available appointments
- **Decryption**: All encrypted fields show readable data for authorized doctors

This enhancement allows you to test the consultation functionality and verify that the decryption is working properly across all doctor pages!
