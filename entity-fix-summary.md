# Entity Framework Relationship Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Multiple Cascade Paths in Message Relationships**

   The SQL Server database was encountering errors due to multiple cascade paths when both `SenderId` and `ReceiverId` foreign keys in the `Messages` table had `CASCADE DELETE` behavior. This caused SQL Server to reject the constraint because it could create circular references.

   **Solution Applied:**
   - Modified the relationships in `ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating()` to use `DeleteBehavior.NoAction`
   - Applied direct SQL script `fix-message-manually.sql` to:
     - Drop existing foreign key constraints
     - Re-add them with `ON DELETE NO ACTION` behavior
     - Add migration record to prevent Entity Framework from reapplying the problematic constraints

2. **Patient-FamilyMember Relationship**

   Originally the `Patient` model was using `int Id` as primary key while `FamilyMember` referenced it with a `string PatientId`, causing incompatible foreign key types.

   **Solution Applied:**
   - Changed `Patient` to use `string UserId` as primary key
   - Updated `FamilyMember.PatientId` to be `string` type
   - Configured the relationship with proper navigation properties

3. **Prescription Model Navigation Property Duplication**

   `Prescription` model had duplicate navigation properties for medications causing ambiguity.

   **Solution Applied:**
   - Removed the duplicate property
   - Kept only the `Medications` property to represent the relationship

4. **Missing or Incorrect Relationship Configurations**

   Several relationships were not properly configured in the `OnModelCreating` method.

   **Solution Applied:**
   - Added explicit configuration for all relationships
   - Set appropriate `OnDelete` behavior for each relationship

## Testing Your Application

After applying these fixes, you should:

1. Verify that user registration and login work correctly
2. Test CRUD operations on Patients, FamilyMembers, Prescriptions, and Messages
3. Verify that deleting records doesn't cause cascade delete errors

## Future Maintenance

When making changes to models or relationships:

1. Always specify the appropriate `OnDelete` behavior to avoid cascade delete conflicts
2. When working with identity models, use `DeleteBehavior.NoAction` or `DeleteBehavior.Restrict` instead of `DeleteBehavior.Cascade`
3. Pay attention to relationship configurations in `OnModelCreating`
4. Consider using SQL scripts for direct database fixes when EF migrations fail
