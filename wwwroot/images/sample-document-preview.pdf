/*
This is a placeholder for a real PDF file.
In a real implementation, you would need to manually add a PDF file named "sample-document-preview.pdf" to this location.

For testing purposes, a simple PDF document with text that says "Residency Proof Document Sample" would be
sufficient for the document preview feature. This PDF will be displayed in the document preview modal when
users view PDF-based residency proof documents.

Steps to create this file:
1. Create a simple one-page PDF document (using Word, Google Docs, or any PDF creator)
2. Add heading text like "Barangay Residency Certificate - Sample" 
3. Include some sample content that might appear in a residency document
4. Save it as "sample-document-preview.pdf" in the wwwroot/images directory
5. Alternatively, use any existing PDF document and rename it
