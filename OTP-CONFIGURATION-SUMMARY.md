# OTP Configuration Summary

## Overview
The OTP (One-Time Password) functionality has been restored and properly configured for the Barangay Health Care system.

## OTP Rules Configuration

### Accounts Requiring OTP:
1. **doctor@example.com** - Doctor account requires OTP verification
2. **nurse@example.com** - Nurse account requires OTP verification  
3. **All Gmail accounts** - Any account ending with @gmail.com or @googlemail.com

### Accounts Exempt from OTP:
1. **admin@example.com** - Admin account is exempt from OTP requirement

### Other Accounts:
- All other non-Gmail accounts (like @yahoo.com, @outlook.com, etc.) do not require OTP

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `Services/OTPService.cs` - Updated `IsOTPRequiredAsync` method to implement the new rules

### OTP Process Flow:
1. User attempts to login with email/username and password
2. System checks if OTP is required for the email address
3. If OTP is required:
   - System generates a 6-digit random OTP
   - OTP is sent to user's email via configured SMTP
   - User is redirected to OTP verification page
   - User enters OTP code
   - System validates OTP and completes login
4. If OTP is not required:
   - User proceeds directly to dashboard after password verification

### Email Configuration:
The system uses Gmail SMTP for sending OTP emails:
- SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- SSL: Enabled
- From Email: barangayexample549@gmail.com

### OTP Security Features:
- 6-digit random OTP codes
- 5-minute expiration time
- One-time use (OTP is removed after successful validation)
- Secure random number generation using cryptographic methods

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases:
1. **admin@example.com** - Should login directly without OTP
2. **doctor@example.com** - Should require OTP verification
3. **nurse@example.com** - Should require OTP verification
4. **anyuser@gmail.com** - Should require OTP verification
5. **anyuser@yahoo.com** - Should login directly without OTP

## Email Template
The OTP email includes:
- Professional HTML template with Barangay Health Care branding
- Clear 6-digit OTP code display
- Security warnings about code expiration and confidentiality
- 5-minute validity period clearly stated

## Configuration Files
- `appsettings.json` - Contains email SMTP settings
- `Program.cs` - Registers OTP and email services
- Email service is properly configured and registered in DI container

## Status
